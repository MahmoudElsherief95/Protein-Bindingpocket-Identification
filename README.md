# Protein-Bindingpocket-Identification

# Project Overview

This project is part of the Structural Bioinformatics Challenge, focusing on the identification of protein binding pockets. A binding pocket is a specific region on the surface of a protein where small molecules (ligands) can potentially bind. Identifying these pockets is crucial for understanding protein function and for drug design.

### Objective:
The main objective of this challenge is to predict which amino acids (AAs) in a protein are part of a binding pocket. This involves analyzing protein structures to identify regions that can interact with small molecules.

# Installing Java
This section of the code is responsible for installing Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system. Java is a necessary dependency for running certain bioinformatics tools like P2Rank, which is used for protein binding site predictions.

### Usage in the Project:



*   Binding Pocket Identification: P2Rank uses machine learning algorithms to
predict binding pockets on protein surfaces. Java is essential for running this tool and performing accurate predictions.

*   Automation: Including this installation step in your notebook ensures that all necessary dependencies are installed automatically, making your code more reproducible and easier to set up in different environments.

  # Downloading and Extracting P2Rank
To utilize P2Rank, a machine learning-based tool for predicting ligand binding sites from protein structures, we need to download and extract its package. The following code downloads the P2Rank package from GitHub and extracts it to a specified location.

# Extracting Test Data
In this section, we handle the extraction of the test data from a zip file, ensuring that the data is ready for processing by P2Rank. The following code sets up the paths, ensures necessary directories exist, and extracts the test data zip file to a specified directory.

# Creating a Dataset File for Test PDB Files
In this section, we create a dataset file that lists all the PDB files extracted from the test zip file. This dataset file is essential for P2Rank to know which files to process.

### Importance :



*   Input Preparation: Creating a dataset file is a crucial step in preparing the input for P2Rank. It ensures that P2Rank knows which PDB files to process.

*   Automation: Automating the creation of the dataset file ensures consistency and accuracy, making it easier to manage large numbers of PDB files.

  # Running P2Rank for Predictions
In this section, we define and use a function to run P2Rank on the test dataset. P2Rank is a tool used to predict ligand binding sites on proteins, and running it on our dataset is a crucial step in generating the predictions.

# Extracting Predictions from P2Rank Output
In this section, we extract the residue IDs from the P2Rank prediction files and format them into a DataFrame suitable for submission. This involves reading each prediction file, extracting relevant data, and preparing the final submission file.

# Analysis of output_test_predictions-3.csv
In this analysis, we performed several key steps to understand and visualize the data contained in the "output_test_predictions.csv" file. Here is a brief summary of what was done:

# Evaluating Predictions with Jaccard Index
This section focuses on evaluating the predictions using the Intersection over Union (IoU) / Jaccard Index. The Jaccard Index is a measure of similarity between two sets, which in this case are the predicted binding sites and the true binding site
